                                        The eighth-generation Honda Civic is a range of compact cars (C-segment) manufactured by Honda between 2005 and 2012, replacing the seventh-generation Civic. Four body styles were introduced throughout its production run, which are sedan, coupe, and both three-door and five-door hatchback. The sedan version was introduced with two distinct styling for different markets, with one of them sold as the Acura CSX in Canada and as the Ciimo 1.8 in China from 2012 until 2016. The hatchback versions formed the European-market Civic range, which received a different architecture, body design and smaller footprint, and solely produced in Swindon, United Kingdom.

                                        In North America, the Honda Civic was available as a sedan and a coupe, designed in Japan and Ohio. The sedan was introduced in September 2005 for the 2006 model year, with various trims including DX, VP, LX, EX, EX with Navigation, and Si. The hybrid was only available as a sedan, and the Si sedan was added to Canada in 2008.

The 2006 models had better fuel economy and lower emissions. The Civic Si and Hybrid had sportier steering, while other models used standard steering.

Due to its size exceeding Japanese compact car regulations, the Civic is no longer classified as a compact sedan in Japan, with the smaller Fit Aria taking its place.

The rear tail lights are also similarly styled. Triangular accents are found front and back, with triangular fog-lamps in front and dual triangle exhaust tips at the back. The rear glass is split into two levels, divided by a spoiler lip and the fuel filler cap is a race-inspired exposed metal effect cap.

                                For the 5-door models, the rear door is hidden away with the door handles tucked away at the corners of the rear windows, creating the illusion of a two-door coupe.

The rear door handle is concealed to create a coupe-like appearance for the five-door model. The rear glass is split into two sections with a spoiler lip, and the fuel filler cap has a race-inspired metal effect.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> It uses a simpler torsion beam rear suspension compared to the double-wishbone system in other variants, which allows for a larger interior space and reduced length.</li>

It features "magic seats" that can be folded or tumbled to create a versatile load area. The fuel tank is positioned under the front seats to maximize rear floor space. There is also a hidden storage compartment in the boot for added convenience.</li>

                                All 8th-generation Honda Civic models are powered by the R18A1 1.8-liter inline-four powertrain with a power output of 140 hp and 128 lb-ft of torque. This is an engine that has been applied to a wide variety of products from the auto manufacturer throughout the years. All pre-facelifted models employ a five-speed manual transmission driving the front wheels as standard, but a five-speed automatic transmission is optionally available. On the final year model, the EX and EX-L trims get the automatic transmission if the navigation package is selected.

                                        The Honda R18A1 is a tried and tested unit consisting of an aluminum-alloy block and cylinder head with a single overhead cam 16 valve configuration employing the brand's i-VTEC technology. The unit's reliable reputation is partly thanks to the integration of a robust cam chain and conventional multi-point fuel injection system. Peak power is available at 6,300 RPM but the engine can spin to an impressive 6,800 RPM redline in true Honda fashion.

Variable cam timing technology is included on the intake but not the exhaust cams. The added timing control corresponds to the "i" in i-VTEC.
